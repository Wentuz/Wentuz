Hey ! 
The name's Tomasz Urbański. Tom for short, but call me Wentuz. 
I am interested in anything that is scaleable, secure and maintainable.

Currently focused on :
☕ Java


I've been fascinated with programming since I was around 15y' old. At first, 
I tried my strength in 🎮 game dev with Unity and C++, then jumped to 🐍 PyThOn and ended up in ☕ Java. 
I had a little bit of a freelance web dev episode in my past.

As a hobby I write plugins for Minecraft servers in Java and host one myself ❤️
